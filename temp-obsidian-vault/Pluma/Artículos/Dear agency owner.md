# Dear agency owner

Stop looking for web developers specialized in WordPress, Webflow, Bricks, Elementor, Wix, or {insert your favorite CMS/builder here}. By doing so, you're inadvertently narrowing your search to:

- Someone with limited knowledge of the web.  
- Someone who has chosen to shortcut their work to focus on areas they enjoy more.

If you're fine with either of these definitions, that’s perfectly fine. You'll find plenty of candidates. But please don't expect more than what naturally comes with this choice:

- Someone with a deeper understanding of a tool rather than the underlying technology.  
- Someone whose passion lies outside the functional web—the interactive, browser-facing part of it. Maybe they're passionate about marketing or design, which is perfectly valid, but not the same as passion for the web itself.

> Note: By *web*, I don’t mean the Internet as a whole or the broader concept of digital marketing. I’m referring specifically to the practical, interactive layer of the web where users interact with visual and functional elements.

## What should you look for instead?

A web developer, specifically a front-end developer, only needs to master one core principle. However, they need to understand it on a deep, obsessive, almost absurd level.

## How a web browser processes and renders code

That’s it. That’s the one skill. It’s the difference between someone who can build something functional and someone who can push the boundaries of what you thought was possible in this very moment.

At their core, a front-end developer is a translator. They take abstract ideas, visualized as mockups, sketches, and prototypes, and transform them into precise visual representations that honor the designer’s vision while creating an interactive experience that communicates with the user through the browser.

You can call them anything: 

- Web Interface Developer
- Front-End Engineer
- UI/UX Developer
- Client-Side Developer
- User Interface Specialist
- Interactive Front-End Developer

The title doesn’t matter. What matters is their unparalleled understanding of what happens when a browser reads code.

## What if you don’t need that specialist right now?

Let’s be realistic. Maybe you’re not at the point where you need that nerd who feels like they stepped out of a sci-fi movie (just guessing your vision of this). And that’s okay. If your current tools are getting the job done, you’re covered. A specialist in {your favorite CMS/builder here} may be exactly what you need to handle repeatable workflows and predictable outcomes.  

But keep in mind: that’s a tradeoff. You’re not hiring someone to explore beyond the boundaries of the tool, but someone who works effectively within it. And if they ever go beyond, consider it a bonus, not the baseline.  

## Why obsession with fundamentals matters

Creativity and innovation come from mastering the basics. Think about it like this:  

Imagine I show you peas for the first time. Then I serve you pea soup. If I repeat this enough times, you’ll associate peas exclusively with pea soup.  

But if I let you touch the peas, open the pods, and ask questions, you’ll start to see the potential: peas in salads, in rice dishes, in stews. You might even end up planting peas, experimenting with their seeds, and—who knows—delving into the laws of inheritance and genetic variation, uncovering the foundational principles of heredity. True story.

Mastering the fundamentals of web development gives you the freedom to innovate, adapt, and create. Without that, you’re simply repeating what’s been done before, unable to move beyond the obvious. Terms like _growth_, _excellence_, _expansion_, and _reach_ only have real meaning when you move past sufficiency and stagnation.

## Developers in the "chosen one" tools

There are tools that represent the web well, or at least follow its principles without adding bloat. What is bloat? It’s those unnecessary scenarios built to protect users who don’t fully understand how the web works. Bloat is that layer of security that doesn’t add real value but shields against basic errors while limiting flexibility.

The tools that really give freedom—while requiring knowledge—are those that allow you to create any structure or interaction the browser can support, without the limitations of bloat. Companies that create these web builders often have specific criteria for how they understand the web: not only how it should work, but also how it should be executed. This often narrows their target audience to those who share their exact criteria, excluding those who have not yet received or embraced that perspective.

Someone with a deep understanding of the web will grasp these tools almost immediately. Not only can they explore and maximize their potential, but they also bring an invaluable ability to adapt to changes, suggest meaningful improvements, and collaborate effectively at scale.

I know, another silly analogy—sorry—but it fits: think of it like a chef. An excellent chef might feel more at home in their own kitchen, using their familiar tools and setup. But if you bring them to your house, even if they’re momentarily disoriented by an unfamiliar environment, they’ll still be able to create the dish of your dreams. Their expertise and intuition transcend the tools at hand.

It’s about deciding where you want to place your friction. Do you want it in the knowledge—the foundational understanding of how things work? Or in the use—the ability to get by within a familiar but limited framework? Consider where you are, what you need, and envision your ideal outcome. Then set expectations accordingly.
