# Managing software deadlines: focus on paths, not results

Shipping software—web development, in my case—has taught me that setting goals at the start of a project is rarely straightforward. Estimating timelines often leads to assumptions, and setting deadlines without clear insight can take us far from the reality of what’s achievable.

When faced with uncertainty, it’s natural to double down on caution. In a mid-career position, the voice in your head might nudge you to add more time to any estimate—"just in case." But while emotions have their place, managing projects requires a logic-driven approach that acknowledges uncertainty without letting it dominate your decisions.

## The culture of underpromise, overdeliver

The principle of "underpromise and overdeliver" is deeply ingrained in many teams. It comes from fear: fear of missing expectations, of overcommitting, of losing credibility. But here’s the truth—this tendency stems from an inability to gauge timelines correctly due to a lack of solid information. It's not a mastery of managing projects; it's a crutch.

This approach starts from fear, which clouds focus. Rather than letting that dictate how you engage with a project, let adjustments come as needed. Don’t begin from a place of doubt. Set clear, logical expectations from the start and trust in your ability to adapt as you gather more information.

## Don't set results, set paths

Instead of focusing solely on the end goal, prioritize clear, actionable paths to reach that goal. It’s a shift from managing only results to managing processes, which fosters better learning, understanding, and collaboration. This principle is particularly crucial in software development, where defining paths for problem-solving and communication proves more effective than prescribing rigid steps.

The act of leading others in software development isn’t about prescribing exact actions—every individual on your team will approach problems differently. It's about creating an environment where each person can apply their expertise to solve the problem in their own way. The software itself, however, is a shared language—a universal tool that your team can understand and manipulate.

To make sure your requests are well understood and met effectively, aim to remove any ambiguity.

Imagine I ask you to “pick something to watch.” Before you act on this request, take a moment to think about what I’m really asking. Not all requests are the same, even if they seem similar on the surface. Here’s how the same request can change in nuance:

- Ask for _Snow White_ on Disney Plus.
- Ask for “a movie on Disney Plus.”
- Ask for “a good movie on Disney Plus.”
- Ask for “a good movie on Disney Plus for tonight.”

Each of these requests contains overlapping ideas—selecting a movie—but they differ significantly in terms of scope, precision, and context. The first request specifies an exact film, while the last introduces additional factors: the platform (Disney Plus), a quality filter (good movie), a time constraint (for tonight), and an implicit need for decision-making.

And let's be honest—thank goodness you’ve at least narrowed it down to Disney, right? But even then, the sheer number of options—ranging from animated classics to the latest Marvel blockbusters—can still leave room for interpretation.

This is similar to how software works. Even when you think you’ve cleared up ambiguity, it can still sneak in and complicate decision-making. Every unspoken assumption is a potential roadblock. When you make requests clearer and more direct, you eliminate unnecessary guesswork and improve the smoothness of the process.

This is where empathy plays a crucial role—not as a psychological framework, but as a pragmatic tool for understanding what your team can comprehend and execute effectively. Empathy here is about clarity and focusing on what’s understood, not just what’s assumed. It’s about engaging fully, understanding the complexity of the task, and breaking down the process in a way that everyone on the team can follow.

### The importance of language: understanding the architecture

Empathy is not just about being understanding; it’s about understanding the right things. When you’re leading a team—especially in software—knowing the _language_ is essential. This means understanding the architecture, the design systems, and the technology your team is working with. It’s not just about knowing how to manage the process; it’s about being fluent in the technical language.

Just as a writer knows grammar to communicate effectively, you need to know the syntax of the tools and technologies your team uses. This is how you ensure clear communication, ask the right questions, and drive decision-making based on technical insight rather than assumptions.

Knowing the language means being present in the conversation—not simply delegating tasks or pushing work down the chain. When you understand the technical structure, you know when to engage deeply with the work, when to ask critical questions, and when to step back. It’s about getting involved at the right level to move things forward.

## Break the work into pieces

If I ask you to estimate how long it takes to go from your desk to the kitchen, make hot chocolate, and serve it to your partner, you’re likely to give a rough estimate. But if you instead break it down step-by-step:

1. Where the chocolate is stored.
2. How you plan to heat the milk.
3. Your preferred serving temperature.

Now we have a real conversation. By understanding your process, I won’t need to ask for a time estimate. I’ll understand your approach clearly.

This same principle applies to software. Don’t just ask for a deadline. Ask for the steps.

Each step in the process should be defined. Every action needs to be clarified. When you break the work into clear components, your team has a much easier time understanding the expectations and executing them effectively. This reduces the chances of miscommunication or misalignment as the project progresses.

Follow these steps, and you’ll empower your team to deliver with confidence. Skip even one of them, and the outcomes can feel disconnected from your vision. When this happens, go back to the beginning and rework the process—from setting the path to defining each piece. Getting involved is crucial to a successful outcome.
