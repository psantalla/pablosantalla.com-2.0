Who had that idea of dividing employees in departments? We humans are obsessed with classifying and organizing, we're obsessed with ideas that look great on paper.

We all do it, the pens with the pens, and the books with the books. It seems rooted to our being.

I've just come up to the conclusion that we do it for mental clarity, but also we feel satisfaction during the process – a dangerous satisfaction actually. We lost our minds into the segmentation process, and we itemize, treat figures as matter.

And then it explode.

We forget about natural connections and the consequences of disconnecting. We’re ready to put the wooden barrels at the back of the warehouse, and we’re childishness petrified when we see the wine that leaked and it's running out through the front door.

Even the more complex outcomes can be explained by the nature of connections. DNA and protein generation, polinización, success of a tribe, wealth, transport. It doesn't, matter, and chances are you are able to generate outcomes you’re not able to imagine. Go talk to a photographer, an economist, a bread maker, literally anyone who may preserve ideas you never though about collecting to. New connections, no matter their nature, create new outcomes, repeated connections create predictable outcomes. You can pick the stage you want to be at.

Let's put the barrels in an intentional, what we consider chaotic place, surrounded by the rice, the beans, the veggies, and the pans. Cause chances are we’ll see the barrel leaking in one of those travels a preparar la sopa con arroz.
