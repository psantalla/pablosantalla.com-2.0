I’m just posting this to make sure my workflow works.

1. I’m writing from Obsidian.  
2. I expect this note to show up as a post on my website.  
3. The image below should render.  
4. I just (hopefully) fixed the workflow by removing a few lines from `.gitignore`, is it working now?

Hi there, this is a weird AI-generated image of Mable (our dog), Blastoise, some fish, my wife, and me, with an invalid filename the system *should* know how to handle.
