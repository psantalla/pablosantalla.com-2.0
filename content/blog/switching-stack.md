It looks like I’m getting back to Obsidian for writing down thoughts. This one was actually written there, and thanks to some behind-the-scenes voodoo, it gets published straight to this site. Cheers to [Frank Noirot](https://franknoirot.co/) for the idea.

I guess I’ll figure out how to design this place in a way that feels right, functionally and aesthetically. But that’s a whole other story. Fun.
