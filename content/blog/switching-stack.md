It looks like I’m getting back to Obsidian for writing down thoughts. This one was actually written there, and thanks to some behind-the-scenes voodoo, it gets published straight to this site. Cheers to [Frank Noirot](https://franknoirot.co/) for the idea.

I guess I'll figure out how to design this place in a way that feels right, functionally and aesthetically. But that's a whole other story. Fun.

If you're curious about how this looked in the days before this setup, feel free to check out [psantalla.github.io/pablosantalla.com/](https://psantalla.github.io/pablosantalla.com/).

No estoy entendiendo por qué no se hacen cambios aquí.
