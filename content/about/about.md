# About

![Pablo Santalla](pablo-santalla-about-main.png)

I officially moved to the US in 2022. It feels like yesterday. We (my wife and I) bought a house in San Pedro, and our daughter was borned in June 2025.

I guess my life goes around a culture, costumes, language, people, ethniticies, biology, evolution, genetics, lifestyle, and yes, that weird concept where creativity and non-tangible technology meets called software.

I'm one of those that collects interests and jump from one to another within an instant.s
