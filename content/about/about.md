# About

I officially moved to the US in 2022. Feels like yesterday, honestly. We bought a house in San Pedro, and our daughter was born in June 2025. Those are the highlights I can think of for now.

I guess my life kind of moves around culture, traditions, language, people, ethnicities, biology, evolution, genetics, lifestyle… and yeah, that weird space where creativity and non-tangible tech meet. Software. That’s where I let myself be a bit chaotic. In a controlled way, I think. There’s something oddly beautiful about this kind of tech that isn’t physical. It’s a weird concept, isn’t it?

I’m one of those people who collect interests and jump from one to another in a second. But when something clicks, I can go deep. Really deep.
