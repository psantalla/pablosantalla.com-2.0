                <p class="t-s--l">Twenty-five years have passed since I first touched a computer. I remember playing
                    Aladdin with a ball mouse. Shortly afterward, in the early 2000s, my friend and neighbor could play
                    FIFA 99 on his PC—not on mine—and since then, I have been constantly searching for the screw to
                    tighten to be able to play on my old Windows 98.

                            <p class="t-s--m">You might've noticed a few glitches on this
                                website—some broken links and unfinished lines. Honestly, I tend to procrastinate and
                                obsess over perfection when it comes to my own projects. But I'm trying to find a
                                balance
                                between showcasing my best work and embracing vulnerability and imperfection.
                                I'm particularly proud though of my commitment to giving more than I receive. I believe
                                in
                                the power
                                of thoughtful processes and taking the time to consider that my actions can positively
                                impact
                                others.</p>

                        <p class="t-s--m"> I also enjoy immersing myself in new cultures and
                            communities. I like to stay in one place for a while and really get to know the people,
                            traditions, and nuances that make a place unique. It's amazing how much you can learn and
                            appreciate by taking the time to observe and engage with your surroundings.</p>
                        <p class="t-s--m">So here I am, improvising every character I'm typing with the hope that you
                            get a

                            some Ali Abdaal ideas where he said that <a class="ut-link _ut-link--inner--notice"

                                down to write the book</a>, like no matter your lack of ideas, you just have to do it.
                            Well, I
                            guess that's what I told myself before starting this text, in case it was super shoddy. The
