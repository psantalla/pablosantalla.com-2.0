                    something caught my attention: they were looking for a 60% web designer and 40% "code ninja."
                    Perhaps
                    each marketing agency has different requirements, but rarely do these two numbers vary
                    significantly.

                                like Figma. They appear colorful and design-oriented, but recently they have expanded

                            here
                            comes the big question: what should a web designer know to effectively convey their
                            design
                            to a developer?

                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">Let's illustrate this with an example. Figma allows you to
                            create almost any type of two-dimensional visual composition. Elements can be freely
                            moved,
                            spaced apart, scaled, and more. It also allows you to follow predefined patterns: you
                            can
                            move elements along a specific axis, space them using defined pixel units, separate them
                            as
                            much as the available space permits, or align them to a side. Essentially, it lets you
                            establish the measurements that make a design meaningful.

                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">Doesn't it seem like designers and developers are
                            sculpting the same artwork but with different chisels? I don't know if it's the perfect
                            analogy, but designers often find themselves working around this concept: "design using
                            my tool, and that'll explain to the you what I've done."

                    <div class="st-col sp-ga--s">
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">When a fully skilled developer struggles to bring a design
                            to production, it can be attributed to different factors. However, in this article,
                            let's focus on one factor—the unavoidable one: designers and developers speak different
                            languages.
                        </p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">Let's go back to Figma for a better understanding. If we
                            place two elements randomly in a frame, we end up with some freely positioned objects;
                            in other words, elements with dreaded position: absolute. While Figma shows what a web
                            browser would interpret for that design, the developer will do the same and try to
                            interpret it. Of course, the developer won't fill a website with absolute positioning
                            everywhere—it's not a good practice. Instead, they'll find the closest approach to this
                            non-specific design. On the other hand, if the designer explains the relationship
                            between these two elements, the developer won't need to guess. Are these elements within
                            the same block? Do they have a specific aspect ratio? Are they aligned along any axis?
                            Does either of them need additional space when they get too close on narrower screens?
                        </p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">The more information the designer provides, the more
                            effective the communication will be in creating the final product.
                        </p>

                </div>
                <div class="st-col sp-ga--l">
                    <h2 class="t-s--xl">How I would approach the issue</h2>
                    <div class="st-col sp-ga--s">
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">Now, let me share my personal perspective on this matter.
                            I believe the real solution isn't about training designers in coding or developers in
                            design. Yes, that would be an ideal solution, but I don't consider it very effective.
                            Instead, the key lies in creating a motivating environment for designers. Personally, I
                            think I was fortunate enough to be equally interested in exploring both fields—maybe
                            leaning more towards one on some days and the other on different days. And I've found
                            that whether you work for an agency or as a freelance, clients appreciate this
                            versatility. Not only that, but I believe a multidisciplinary profile in this regard is
                            infectious.
                        </p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">In conclusion, bridging the gap between design and web
                            development brings numerous advantages for both professionals and the final product.
                            Improved collaboration, informed decision-making, and consideration of scalability and
                            defined styles lead to more efficient development and an enhanced user experience.
                            Embracing a multidisciplinary mindset can boost creativity and innovation, benefiting
                            the overall design and development process.
