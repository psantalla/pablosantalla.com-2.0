                <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">When discussing spacing in web design, it's essential to distinguish

                    <h2 class="t-s--2xl">Why Spacing Matters</h2>
                    <div class="st-col sp-ga--s">
                        <div class="st-col--mobile sp-ga--2xl sp-ga--s--mobile">
                            <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">Even though website visitors may not pinpoint visual
                                inconsistencies precisely, they do notice them.
                        </div>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">As web designers, we use terminology to identify visual
                            patterns, hierarchies, and consistencies.
                        </p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--s ut-opacity--60">
                            A web designer's role is to guide the user's natural gaze to their desired content.
                        </p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">The most frequently visited websites, not necessarily the
                            flashiest ones, establish visual patterns that make users feel comfortable. The repetition
                            of navigation flows, similar to walking or driving along familiar routes, creates a sense of
                            security. It's not just the flows; what users encounter along the way greatly influences
                            their experience. We navigate more comfortably when we understand how streets and highways
                            connect, the width of lanes, or the locations of intersections. Visual references like
                            traffic signs or lane markings also contribute to our comfort. Most importantly, we
                            appreciate knowing that for different routes, we'll have a similar experience if our
                            references follow these learned patterns. You've probably noticed the close relationship
                            between "experience" and "user."
                        </p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">Spacing is another element of this experience. It's crucial
                            because it's intrinsic to our understanding of the world. We bring related objects closer
                            together, sometimes grouping them tightly or placing them at specific distances, making room
                            for other objects or ourselves.
                        </p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">If I give you four chairs and a square table, you'll arrange
                            them similarly to how I would. If I add another chair, you'll face the same challenge. If I
                            provide a sixth chair and a second table with two more chairs, we'll rearrange them
                            similarly. Following familiar patterns allows us to navigate the world with confidence.
                            These behaviors also apply to the digital realm.
                        </p>

                <div class="st-col sp-ga--l">
                    <h2 class="t-s--2xl">Spacing Direction</h2>
                    <div class="st-col sp-ga--s">
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">In our two-dimensional web world, we can break down spacing
                            into two main categories:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="com-ul sp-my--2xs st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">
                            <li>Vertical spacing</li>
                            <li>Horizontal spacing</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--s ut-opacity--60">
                            Some designers work with both types equally. Personally, I don't consider it a major
                            mistake, but it can significantly impact the final user experience.
                        </p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">
                            I distinguish between vertical and horizontal spacing for a straightforward reason: space
                            serves functionality, not aesthetics. Vertical and horizontal spacing serve different
                            functions.
                        </p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">
                            Reading or analyzing elements horizontally is continuous. We read sentences without stopping
                            as we move from one letter to the next, one symbol to the next, or one element to the next.
                            Line breaks are the most disruptive, as they interrupt the flow of information. A double
                            space between lines can separate two paragraphs, a slightly larger space separates different
                            statements, and so on. Websites follow the same principle. Greater vertical spacing disrupts
                            continuity, isolating sections and preventing interaction when the space between them is
                            significant.
                        </p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">
                            Vertical spacing is not a new concept in interface design; magazines and newspapers use it.
                        </p>

                    <div class="st-col sp-ga--s">
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">Few websites limit themselves to vertical scrolling. Webpages
                            have virtually infinite space to display content, with no specific limit on how much can be
                            added above or below.
                        </p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">Vertical spacing allows us to categorize elements and suggest
                            relationships based on their proximity. This infinite nature of vertical spacing allows for
                            flexibility along the y-axis.

                    <div class="st-col sp-ga--s">
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">Vertical spacing maintains a constant number of pixels, REMs,
                            or other units of measurement, regardless of the viewport's height. It's not advisable to
                            use percentage units (%) or VH for vertical spacing. If the spacing between two paragraphs
                            is 12px, it remains the same regardless of the browser window's height.
                        </p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">Many highly visited websites employ an 8-pixel vertical
                            spacing system.

                    <div class="st-col sp-ga--s">
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">In web design, horizontal spacing serves convenience and
                            facilitation. Navigation menu links are horizontally spaced for user convenience, displaying
                            essential information while offering the option to navigate to another page. Horizontal
                            spacing is also used to separate two columns of text, making reading easier by preventing
                            long strings of words that can be challenging to follow when transitioning to a new line.
                        </p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">Various factors lead to horizontal spacing, including
                            inherited practices from print formats and common design patterns. However, the primary goal
                            is to enhance the user's browsing experience.
                        </p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">Horizontal spacing presents challenges in design, which is why
                            new guidelines have emerged to ensure consistency across different environments. For
                            instance, the twelve-column system for interface design adapts well to narrower screens.
                        </p>

                    <div class="st-col sp-ga--s">
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">Unlike vertical spacing, horizontal space is constrained by
                            the width of the browser window, determined by the screen size. While horizontal scrolling
                            is an option, it should not become the norm.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--s ut-opacity--60">
                        Mixing two types of scrolling confuses users. Reserve it for specific situations, clearly
                        indicating the possibility of horizontal scrolling. Additionally, remember that not all screens
                        support touch input, and not all mice have horizontal scrolling capabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">
                        To address this constraint, we need an adaptive horizontal spacing system that scales
                        proportionally with the screen width. Horizontal spacing rules determine the number of columns
                        that fit on a smaller screen, stacking those that don't fit.
